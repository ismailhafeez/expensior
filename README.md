# expensior
Say goodbye to cluttered messes of paper receipts!

Expensior is a OCR based reciept scanner that scans reciepts, saves them and their details for you, and gives you a financial grade (based on that reciept data).
This is the back-end web server to the mobile app. All the magic happens here!
How Expensior works is:
  > Take a photo (or upload a saved photo)
  > Expelsior takes the data from the photo.
  > Expelsior determains key pieces of info, such as the seller, date and total price!
  > Expelsior saves this data, and can show it at any time!
  > Expelsior also uses this data to grade you!
